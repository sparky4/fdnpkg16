
Stuff that I might do some day...

- switch the TCP stack to use picoTCP
    --> or (better?) make FDNPKG a 16-bit application and use real-mode Watt32
DONE

- make it possible to install sources for a package that was installed without sources
    --> store sources separately (*.zib + *.zis instead of a single *.zip)
DONE WITH REINSTALL AND INSTALL WITH SOURCES

- for a given on-disk file, make it possible to check if it belongs to a package
I'll discuss this with FreeDOS people what this means

- (?) look for %DOSDIR%\PACKAGES\%PKGNAME%\REMOVE.BAT and INSTALL.BAT scripts
I'll discuss this with FreeDOS people what this means

- optimize db-related operations (creating db, loading it from file), to speed up the process
    --> or move this to server-side? but what about from-disk installs then? could use same format as today, reading directly from disk instead of compiling a database aggregate
This is a 1.0 feature I should implement this soon, but I am afraid of breaking it.

- look for FDNPKG.CFG first in current EXE dir instead of in %DOSDIR%/BIN (but %FDNPKG.CFG% should still have priority over everything else)
DONE!

- add a way to install a specific version of a package without relying on the latest version autodetection (fdnpkg install pkgname/0.50)
again This is a 1.0 feature I should implement this soon, but I am afraid of breaking it. but I can try with this one!
    cannot be done need work on repo/server side (possible! just need fdrepo updated)

- when the connection to network fails, we should continue with what we have (looks like wattcp is calling exit() if it fails to get an IP via DHCP?)
I dont think this can't be implemented. Because it would not have any package files! You can (re)install packages via locally on a disk! :D



- Implement modification-date version finding
    --> Needs server repo side and the making of index16.gz file son server which has this additional info! :D


- force install!
    --> prompt sent to force install a file if it exists
DONE

- multipackage install!!! >:3
    --> now we getting into big leagues!! :D program should work as "fdnpkg16 reinstall fdnpkg16 fdnpkg" xD
