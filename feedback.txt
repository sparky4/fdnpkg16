fdnpkg16 is legitimately one of the best things to happen to freedos ever

i am not saying this out of bias or anything. i am actually saying this out of actually using the program and knowing damn well that it works great even on an original IBM PC

having a very functional network package manager on fucking DOS of all things is just incredible

fdimples was VERY slow and the original fdnpkg was quite buggy
and yes the fact it works on 16 bit PCs is the best part, easily

Also, thanks a lot for taking over the maintenance of FDNPKG. I was worried when Mateusz abandoned it/folded it to SvarDOS but now that it's getting new features that's no longer true 🙂 [:)]
