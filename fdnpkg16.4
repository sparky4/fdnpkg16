# The maximum time FDNPKG can keep its internal package database cache.

# Whether or not to install sources (when available) along with binaries.
# This can be overriden via command line at any time.
# Possible values:
#  0 - don't install sources by default
#  1 - install sources by default
#
installsources 1


##############################################################################
# Whether or not to install "link" files. Some packages need to be callable
# from within the %PATH%. Such packages come with a 'link' file that is
# supposed to be placed in a directory soemwhere in the %PATH% (see the 'dir
# link' directive later in this configuration file for setting the exact
# location).
# If you already use some kind of similar mechanism and you do not wish to
# duplicate it, then you can set tell FDNPKG to skip links installation.
# Possible values:
#  0 - installs links for packages that have them
#  1 - skip link files
#
skiplinks 0

# FDNPKG can remap drive letters during software installation. This is a hack
# that is most probably useless in all production environments, but can be
# used by OS installers during install time (when the current drives letters
# do not match letters drive will obtain once the system is installed). This
# parameter takes an even-sized string of drive pairs. Let's consider this:
#
# mapdrives cddx
#
# The above setting means "anything that would normally be installed to C:
# needs to be redirected to D:, while everything that would be installed to
# D: is to be redirected to X:". FDNPKG not only redirects files during
# installation of packages, but also pretends the files were actually
# installed on the original drive - which means the packages will be fully
# functional (including upgrades and removals) on the target system.
